Our new and updated website for CU Blueprint available at [carletonblueprint.org](https://carletonblueprint.org/)



## Motivation for Project

In 2021, we decided to build our club a brand new website with an improved UI and a more modern tech stack. The reason for this change was that our old website was built with Pug and had outdated design decisions.

To meet these challenges, our team designed a [new UI using Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Qt7bGynNItu0hUvPu0EPGa/Draft-Website-Design?node-id=0%3A1) and is currently working on developing it using React, Typescript and styled components. 



## Site Map

Our site contains information about CUBlueprint's mission statement, our current projects, our team, how to get involved and sign up forms for volunteers and non-profit organizations. 

The following is a visual map of how to navigate our website:

## How to run the website in Development

First make sure you install [Node.js v16.20.2](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.20.2/). You can use nvm [(Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch between node versions.

Next, to install dependencies run the following command inside the project directory ("cublueprint.github.io"):

### `yarn install`

Then to run the project in development mode on a local server, run the following command:

### `yarn start`

This command will run the app on default [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It can be accessed via a web browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

todo: add more specific steps here...

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
